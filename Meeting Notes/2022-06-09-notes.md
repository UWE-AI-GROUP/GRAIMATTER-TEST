## Notes from WP1/WP2 meeting June 9 2022

### WP1
 Alba to start shared to-do list
 Slowness on AWS - as per CC we can speed things up by 'turbo-charging
 SR - bottleneck is Alba doing everything
#### Plans
 ABJ and JL to run AWS pipeline on own experiments
 Anyone who wants to be involved in PICTURES experiment with Susan Kreuger to indicate this
 
### WP2
 Need beta testers for wrappers
 Choice of epsilon values: JL, 5-10 is about as low as you can go on a 1000x10 dataset
 RP has attribute inference tests running
 Trying to come up with a single measure of attribute inference
 Currently using 'risk at single most-insecure attribute'

### Safe base models/safe ensembles
 SR: straightforward to find example where random forest has high attack metric, but no individual models do
 Conclusion: cannot make random forest safe by restricting parameters of individual trees
 Also demonstrated that a safe ensemble does not imply safe base models, but difficult to explicitly train in this way.
 JS has done some work on k-anonymity in RFs: individual trees can be k-anonymous but forest is not
 JS: going to do some experiments to relate k-anonymity to inference attack metrics.

### Future/ongoing work
 #### DP random forests 
  - to look at; also look at ensembles of arbitrary DP models
 #### Incorporation of synthetic data generators: several plans
  - SDG-as-classifier underway (train model to >>n synthetic data samples)
  - Direct SDG testing underway (use distribution induced by SDG as MIA classifier)
  - Recommendation will be something like: either use DP method, or SDG-as-MIA must reach acceptable thresholds for classifier
  - If using SDG inside safe haven: if using instance-based method, SDG must be safe; if not, SDG+classifier must be safe
  - Data augmentation still to be considered
 #### Papers
  - CC: what experiments would round out what we are doing
  - aim to submit a paper by the end of the grant

### Plans/To do
  - Talk about metrics/thresholds
  - Organise a meeting/document to collate manuscript ideas
  - Alba to chair next week
