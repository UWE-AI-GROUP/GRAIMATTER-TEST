# WP 1 & 2 Meeting, 2022-02-24 - agenda and notes

1. Apologies
1. WP1 update
    - Building code to allow for large searches across hyper-parameters / models / datasets / attack scenarios (Alba / Alberto) [issues 54 and 55 - remain open]
    - Work on glossary (All)
    - Synthetic data work (James)
    - Finding datasets [issue 50]. Update on Texas data (Alba)
    - Wrapper for tf-privacy (issue 46) - Alberto?
    - Results for default param experiments (issues 43 and 44) - Alba: is this done? Can we close and point people to the results?
    - Documentation of attack types (issue 40): See https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/blob/main/documentation/attack_types.MD Suggest others check and make changes, and then we close the issue
1. WP2 update
    - Updates to SafeModel wrappers:
        + Move to multiple inheritance paradigm / refactoring
        + Support additional model saving formats
        + Addition of unit tests
        + Move to JSON for safe rule set and output file format
        + Extension of safe rule set to include logical combinations of operators (OR and AND)
    - Clarification of privacy tool assessment criteria
1. Shared
    - Issue 48 - flowchart to show risks. Currently example on [miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOQRt5kI=/). are we happy with this tool -- should we continue to populate?
    - Keeping data from researchers (issue 47). Suggest we close as this would be part of any solutions we propose.
    - Issue 17 - text on unsupervised learning? Looks stale - can someone take this on?
    - Issue 11 - "prioritised list of algorithms to work on" - is this now complete? can someone clarify the chosen list?
1. AOCB
1. Chair for next meeting - according to the list (and restricting it to core WP1&2 folk), next person is Alberto
