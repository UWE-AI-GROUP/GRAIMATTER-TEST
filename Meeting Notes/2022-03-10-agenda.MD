# Agenda meeting 10/03/2022

Appologies from Simon, Jim

1.Update WP2
- SafeModel now checks to see whether user has changed any nmodel params between fit() and rerquestRelease()
- 2 different versions of safekeras ready to go but need some collective decisions/guidance about choices of DP parameters
- work on attribute inference


2.Update WP1
  - Preliminary results for some classifiers: RandomForest, DecisionTree, SVC
  - Doing a big search on hyper-param values and seeing the extent to which MIA metrics are predictable is something that Simon’s never seen a similar type of analysis before. Given we have all the code and it’s just a question of running experiments, I wonder if others would be keen to write this up as a short paper for somewhere? We’d need to run more experiments, but it would help to solidify our experiments, get us some useful reviewer comments, and we have to do the experiments anyway. 


4.Other

Questions raised

-	Find other image datasets
-	How much confidence does the attacker need to have before it’s considered a breach?
-	Is the combination of different types of data more disclosive?
-	If multiple models from the same data are released, does this give more information to a potential attacker?


Next chair: Esma
