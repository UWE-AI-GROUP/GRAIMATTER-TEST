Simple notebook used to explore problems with creating multiple instances from a sub-class of tf.keras.Model

Work is being reported as a bug to main tensorflow project: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/16582

copy of safemodel file just in here for now so that if I crack the first problem, I can make sure multiple inheritance works properly.
