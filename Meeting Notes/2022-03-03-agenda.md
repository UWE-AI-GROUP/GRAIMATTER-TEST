# WP 1 & 2 Meeting, 2022-03-03 - agenda and notes
1. Apologies
1. WP1 Update
	- Issues [46](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/46), [54](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/54), and [55](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/55): Code to automate tests on combinations of hyperparameters and on different datasets. 
		+ We have working hyper-parameter sweep and (Simon or Alba) can show results. Will close 54&55.
		+ Alberto restricts work to TF-NNs. The search space here is huge. A possible way to reduce the search space is to find good models then try dropout and regularization.
		+ Decide on what to report and how.
		+ Request to support NN from dataset interface. In principle, the only difference between sklearn and NN inputs should be to one-hot encode labels and maybe some categorical data, if present. Will look in more detail.
	- Issue [61](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/61): Transfer Learning.
		+ Look for literature on possible leaks from *feature extractors*.
	- Issue [40](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/60): Define attack scenarios for experiments. Document [here](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/blob/main/documentation/attack_types.MD). 
		+ Any missing comments / contributions?
	- Synthetic data generation.
1. WP2 Update
	- Issues [58](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/58) and [60](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/60): SafeModel wrappers.
		+ Consistency between trained and released models.
	- Issue [33](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/33) Agree what membership means for images. 
	- Issue [13](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/13) Report on what types of attack would be relevant for FedML across TREs
		+ Discarded Byzantine and poisoning attacks (TREs are trusted).
		+ Plan to consider MIA, AIA and inversion.
1. Shared
	- Issues [34](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/34) and [48](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/48): Glossary and flowchart to structure risks / attack types / models.
		+ Start from [NHSx](https://nhsx.github.io/ai-dictionary)? Links to more detailed information could be included (wiki pages, blog posts with examples, etc.)
	- Issue [17](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/17): Develop text for final report about unupervised learning. Any new developement here?
	- Issue [47](https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/47) Keeping data from researchers. *Agreed to close issue*.
1. AOCB
1. Chair for next meeting - according to the list (and restricting it to core WP1&2 folk), next person is Alba
