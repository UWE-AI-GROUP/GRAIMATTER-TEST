Update WP1
 - Checked possible rounding issues - couldn't find any obvious systematic changes (https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/pull/122)
 - Started planning PPIE workshop 2 (ML / AI)
 - Worst v Salem1 v Salem2 results (Alba and Simon working on it)
 - 
Update WP2
- attribute inference now working for continous variables, raise some issues about data pre-processing
- JL's Dp-SVM code being put into SafeSVMClassifier() class

Issues
- Sharing expeimental results so we can all analyse them
- Maybe we should collate a single *how-to...* guide for the various tools we have created
- Defining a format for a description of the input data format to be exported alongside a trained model
-  (this could let us automate some attacks for the TRE output checkers)

Next chair
