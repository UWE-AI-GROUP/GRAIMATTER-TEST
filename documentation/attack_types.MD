# Attack types

## Introduction

This document summarises the different attack types that we are considering. The hope is that it will form a shared understanding of the different modes of attack and a shared vocabulary.

## Definitions

**Membership Inference Attack**: a form of attack in which the attacker has a data object and they wish to determine whether or not that data object was part of the training set.

**Target Model**: the machine learning model that has been trained within the TRE and that researchers want to release. The model can be queried by presenting values to the inputs and observing the predictions that it makes. Attackers can also look within the model object to potentially see the parameters of the model, its architecture and, for example, how it was optimised. The target model will be trained on data observations (health parameters for indiviuals etc, or images)

**Attack Model**: the model that the attacker will use to determine if, for example, the data example they have is part of the training set or not (for MIA). Attack models are typically not trained on health parameters, but trained on the _probabilities_ obtained when the data object is passed through a predictive model.

**Shadow Model**: attackers will sometimes train _shadow_ models, that in some sense emulate the target model as part of their attack. More details below.

# Black box attacks

Black box in the sense that none of these attacks need access to the internals of the model.

## The _Worst Case_ (maybe) attack

This scenario is presented as a potential worst case that may help elucidate the attackability of a model. It is not intended as a realistic attack scenario. However, it is easy to implement and therefore might be beneficial with TREs to assess models.

### How it works

The attacker has _white box_ access to the target model. The attacker also has access to the data used to train the model and a second dataset from the same distribution (e.g. the original data is split into training and test portions and the attacker has access to both).

There is no shadow model in this attack (it is not required).

The attacker first presents both data sets to the trained target model and records the predictive probabilities obtained for each observation. These probabilities become the data to _train_ the attack model. The attack model does not need to be of the same type as the target model -- any binary classification model can be used. The target value for each attack model training example is 1 or 0 depending on whether or not the example was from the target model training data, or not. The attack model is trained on this data.

To use this model for risk assessment a further data partition is made to split the attack model input data into train and test partitions. The attack model is trained on the train partition and then assessed on the test partition to obtain, for example, the attack AUC, and various other metrics.

## The Shokri Attack

This is the attack format presented in the original Shokri paper, in which Membership Inference Attacks are first defined.

### How it works

The attacker knows the structure of the target model (i.e. what type of model it is, and perhaps hyper-parameters). The attacker does not have access to the exact training data. The attacker builds a number of shadow models. Each shadow model is an estimate of the target model (i.e. they are trained to perform the same task as the target model). Because the attacker doesn't have access to the actual training data, they have to synthesise data to train the shadow models.

Each shadow model can then be presented with the data that trained it, and data that didn't, to generate the predictive probabilities that can be used to train an attack model.

Shokri presents several methods for the creation of this synthetic data for training shadow models.
