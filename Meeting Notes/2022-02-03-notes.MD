# Notes for WP1 + WP2 meeting, 2022-02-03

Chair & notetaker: JL

Present: CC, MM, AM, SR, EMB, JL, ACB, RP, JS

1. Apologies etc

No apologies

2. WP1 update
  
  - ACB and ABJ: reproduction of Salem paper, black and white box attacks

Salem paper based on Shokri attacks on shadow models, and proposed different model scenarios with and without shadow models (see schematic). 

Ongoing discussion over which models to use. 

ABJ: implemented three scenarios suggested by Salem to establish how data needs to be prepared to carry out attacks. Used synthetic data to enable overfitting of model. 
 - Scenario 1 uses a single channel model with data from the same distribution of original dataset
 - scenario 2, shadow model, different distribution
 - scenario 3 finds optimal threshold for classification probability
All attacks worked to approximately similar degrees

Worth classifying best- and worst- case scenarios: does an attacker have real data/can they train a supervised model?

SR: next step is to do a set of experiments to compare scenarios to see if setting makes a big difference. 

Aim next week to bring back results and do some comparisons

Also aim to have a document explaining what these scenarios are. 

EMB: start to document experiments in plain english

JS: could we end up with a piece of code in which algorithms/parameters could be plugged in.

JS: as well as overfitting, large numbers of classes increase disclosure risk. Possibility of tuning the number of classes?.

  - Looking into tensorflow privacy and whether the extent to which this can be used for non-tensorflow models

ABJ: Tensorflow privacy can be largely used, but some need activations of final layers of neural networks. Generally just need prediction probabilities and loss. Generally assumes that the shadow model is the trained model itself. This is probably a reasonable assumption, but these are still white-box attacks.
  
  - JL: MIA possibilities on exported synethetic data with DP generation



3. WP2 overall update (RP)

JS: safe wrapper class under development. Decision tree implemented; RF coming.  Constraints are read when class instance is initiated. Aims to output in format ready for TREs. 

Difficulties will arise with Keras when it is necessary to call DP optimisation algorithm. 

For now, aim is to mimic methods used by Scikit-learn.

RP: Adversarial robustness toolkit. 

AM: Looking at federated learning. 



4. General discussion on focus of WP1/2 - EMB/ABJ to lead

EMB - how realistic a scenario should we consider; what will the attacker have access to?

RP: embedded training data is a different area

JS: middle ground where you have a trained model, but not the data.

JL: white box is a worst-case example: if we can defend against worst-case, we can defend against better case

EMB: some models embed their training data, which cannot be released at all

SR: some models depend on it but don't need to include it when released.

EJ: how do we capture these things to avoid discussing them twice? Would it be worth having a flow diagram, with concensus indicated

EMB starting a tree-like diagram of this. 

JS: agree - ensure that effort is not being duplicated. Add results from papers onto schematic. 

JL: consider defining all the various types of data which go into the model fitting process and classify attackers based on which of these they have access for.

RP: have a 'model zoo'; once models are trained; save them back in

EJ: worth having a folder in AWS when that is available

JS: someone decide on a folder structure and naming convention for models


5. Glossary (all)

SR: two/several meanings of white box attack

  - Decide on level of detail; glossary will probably be part of published output
  
MM:  

  - Discusion of content and subheadings
  
  
6. Timelines for next two weeks

Summary of plans
 - Work towards flow diagram summarising types of attack
 - Set up folder with fitted models (EMB kindly offered to lead; to set up issue on github)
 - Work towards WP1 summary next week
 - Work towards WP2 basic wrapper
 - Merge github and teams version of glossary to github (JL/MM)


7. AOB

8. Decide on chair / notetaker for next week

AM kindly volunteered
