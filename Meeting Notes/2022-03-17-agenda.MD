   Synthetic data scenario. Interested in people’s thoughts about the scenario in which a researcher wants to remove a model from a TRE which was trained on some dataset A. Simultaneously, the owners of dataset A (e.g. public health Scotland) have released a synthetic version of the dataset to the public. This could make shadow model training quite easy…c.f. the synthetic English A&E data that Chris pointed us to. Does the existence of this make disclosure of models trained on the real A&E data more risky? Issue here: https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/issues/96
