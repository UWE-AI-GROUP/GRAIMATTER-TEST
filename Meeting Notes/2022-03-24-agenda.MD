# GRAIMatter WP 1+2 meeting agenda
## March 24, 2022

1. Apologies - Simon, Alba
2. WP1 Update
	- Hyperparameter/model loop experiments
    + Ongoing work to include boosted trees, SVMs, and SDGs
    + DP SVC working within the loop (some initial results here: https://github.com/jim-smith/GRAIMatter/pull/116)
    + Adding additional attack scenario comprising SDG-based shadow data as discussed last week
    + Some results:
      - AUC by classifier at 95% CI <img src="https://dmail.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/sites/GRAIMatter/Shared%20Documents/General/ExperimentalResults/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p12/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p121024_2.png?csf=1&web=1&e=DLcZNC">
      - Advantage by classifier at 95% CI <img src=https://dmail.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/sites/GRAIMatter/Shared%20Documents/General/ExperimentalResults/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p12/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p121024_1.png?csf=1&web=1&e=ggLR4z>
      - More metric [pointplots](https://dmail.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/sites/GRAIMatter/Shared%20Documents/General/ExperimentalResults/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p12/pointplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA_p11-p121024_2.png?csf=1&web=1&e=DLcZNC) and [density plots]("https://dmail.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/GRAIMatter/Shared%20Documents/General/ExperimentalResults/densityplots_RF_DT_SVC_ADA.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=GkJ8w9")
3. WP2 Update
       - Attribute Inference experiments
       
4. Shared
    - Need to start thinking about what (if any) recommendations we currently have (for April 21st DARE meeting)
    - sanity checking the precision of datasets
    - do/should we preprocess datasets (standard scaling etc) [comment from SR: kind of have to for some methods, e.g. SVM (standard kernels don't make much sense if features exist on wildly different scales) and a researcher could easily add it as part of the trained model]
5. Logistic
  - In-person work at end of April
6. AOB
7. Next meeting
